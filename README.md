# Arduino Traffic Lights

Finally decided to open-source my code for our final
arduino project.

Code in this repository is only guaranteed to work
on the Arduino Uno, any other platforms such as the
Arduino Mega or (god forbid) an ATTiny10/25/whatever are not guaranteed to work.

Also to the Teknoys who think they can use this code
or whatever, good f*cking luck trying, skid :index_pointing_at_the_viewer: :skull:
